# Suites

A **suite** is a YAML configuration file that defines a complete evaluation specification. It's the central piece that ties together your dataset, target agent, grading criteria, and pass/fail thresholds.

<Note>
**Quick overview:**
- **Single file defines everything**: Dataset, agent, graders, and success criteria all in one YAML
- **Reusable and shareable**: Version control your evaluation specs alongside your code
- **Multi-metric support**: Evaluate multiple aspects (accuracy, quality, tool usage) in one run
- **Multi-model testing**: Run the same suite across different LLM models
- **Flexible filtering**: Test subsets using tags or sample limits
</Note>

**Typical workflow:**
1. Create a suite YAML defining what and how to test
2. Run `letta-evals run suite.yaml`
3. Review results showing scores for each metric
4. Suite passes or fails based on gate criteria

An evaluation suite is a YAML configuration file that defines a complete test specification.

## Basic Structure

```yaml
name: my-evaluation  # Suite identifier
description: Optional description of what this tests  # Human-readable explanation
dataset: path/to/dataset.jsonl  # Test cases

target:  # What agent to evaluate
  kind: agent
  agent_file: agent.af  # Agent to test
  base_url: http://localhost:8283  # Letta server

graders:  # How to evaluate responses
  my_metric:
    kind: tool  # Deterministic grading
    function: exact_match  # Grading function
    extractor: last_assistant  # What to extract from agent response

gate:  # Pass/fail criteria
  metric_key: my_metric  # Which metric to check
  op: gte  # Greater than or equal
  value: 0.8  # 80% threshold
```

## Required Fields

### name
The name of your evaluation suite. Used in output and results.

```yaml
name: question-answering-eval
```

### dataset
Path to the JSONL or CSV dataset file. Can be relative (to the suite YAML) or absolute.

```yaml
dataset: ./datasets/qa.jsonl  # Relative to suite YAML location
```

### target
Specifies what agent to evaluate. See [Targets](/evals/core-concepts/targets) for details.

### graders
One or more graders to evaluate agent performance. See [Graders](/evals/core-concepts/graders) for details.

### gate
Pass/fail criteria. See [Gates](/evals/core-concepts/gates) for details.

## Optional Fields

### description
A human-readable description of what this suite tests:

```yaml
description: Tests the agent's ability to answer factual questions accurately
```

### max_samples
Limit the number of samples to evaluate (useful for quick tests):

```yaml
max_samples: 10  # Only evaluate first 10 samples
```

### sample_tags
Filter samples by tags (only evaluate samples with these tags):

```yaml
sample_tags: [math, easy]  # Only samples tagged with "math" AND "easy"
```

Dataset samples can include tags:
```jsonl
{"input": "What is 2+2?", "ground_truth": "4", "tags": ["math", "easy"]}
```

### num_runs
Number of times to run the entire evaluation suite (useful for testing non-deterministic behavior):

```yaml
num_runs: 5  # Run the evaluation 5 times
```

Default: 1

### setup_script
Path to a Python script with a setup function to run before evaluation:

```yaml
setup_script: setup.py:prepare_environment  # script.py:function_name
```

The setup function should have this signature:
```python
def prepare_environment(suite: SuiteSpec) -> None:
    # Setup code here
    pass
```

## Path Resolution

Paths in the suite YAML are resolved relative to the YAML file location:

```
project/
├── suite.yaml
├── dataset.jsonl
└── agents/
    └── my_agent.af
```

```yaml
# In suite.yaml
dataset: dataset.jsonl  # Resolves to project/dataset.jsonl
target:
  agent_file: agents/my_agent.af  # Resolves to project/agents/my_agent.af
```

Absolute paths are used as-is.

## Multi-Grader Suites

You can evaluate multiple metrics in one suite:

```yaml
graders:
  accuracy:  # Check if answer is correct
    kind: tool
    function: exact_match
    extractor: last_assistant

  completeness:  # LLM judges response quality
    kind: rubric
    prompt_path: rubrics/completeness.txt
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    extractor: last_assistant

  tool_usage:  # Verify correct tool was called
    kind: tool
    function: contains
    extractor: tool_arguments  # Extract tool call arguments
```

The gate can check any of these metrics:

```yaml
gate:
  metric_key: accuracy  # Gate on accuracy metric (others still computed)
  op: gte  # Greater than or equal
  value: 0.9  # 90% threshold
```

Results will include scores for all graders, even if you only gate on one.

## Examples

### Simple Tool Grader Suite

```yaml
name: basic-qa  # Suite name
dataset: questions.jsonl  # Test questions

target:
  kind: agent
  agent_file: qa_agent.af  # Pre-configured agent
  base_url: http://localhost:8283  # Local server

graders:
  accuracy:  # Single metric
    kind: tool  # Deterministic grading
    function: contains  # Check if ground truth is in response
    extractor: last_assistant  # Use final agent message

gate:
  metric_key: accuracy  # Gate on this metric
  op: gte  # Must be >=
  value: 0.75  # 75% to pass
```

### Rubric Grader Suite

```yaml
name: quality-eval  # Quality evaluation
dataset: prompts.jsonl  # Test prompts

target:
  kind: agent
  agent_id: existing-agent-123  # Use existing agent
  base_url: https://api.letta.com  # Letta Cloud

graders:
  quality:  # LLM-as-judge metric
    kind: rubric  # Subjective evaluation
    prompt_path: quality_rubric.txt  # Rubric template
    model: gpt-4o-mini  # Judge model
    temperature: 0.0  # Deterministic
    extractor: last_assistant  # Evaluate final response

gate:
  metric_key: quality  # Gate on this metric
  metric: avg_score  # Use average score
  op: gte  # Must be >=
  value: 0.7  # 70% to pass
```

### Multi-Model Suite

Test the same agent configuration across different models:

```yaml
name: model-comparison  # Compare model performance
dataset: test.jsonl  # Same test for all models

target:
  kind: agent
  agent_file: agent.af  # Same agent configuration
  base_url: http://localhost:8283  # Local server
  model_configs: [gpt-4o-mini, claude-3-5-sonnet]  # Test both models

graders:
  accuracy:  # Single metric for comparison
    kind: tool
    function: exact_match
    extractor: last_assistant

gate:
  metric_key: accuracy  # Both models must pass this
  op: gte  # Must be >=
  value: 0.8  # 80% threshold
```

Results will show per-model metrics.

## Validation

Validate your suite configuration before running:

```bash
letta-evals validate suite.yaml
```

This checks:
- Required fields are present
- Paths exist
- Configuration is valid
- Grader/extractor combinations are compatible
