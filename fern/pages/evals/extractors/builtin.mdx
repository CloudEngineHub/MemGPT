# Built-in Extractors

Letta Evals provides a set of built-in extractors that cover the most common extraction needs.

<Note>
**What are extractors?** Extractors determine what part of an agent's response gets evaluated. They take the full conversation trajectory and extract just the piece you want to grade.
</Note>

## Common Extractors

### last_assistant

Extracts the last assistant message content.

```yaml
extractor: last_assistant  # Most common - gets final response
```

### first_assistant

Extracts the first assistant message content.

```yaml
extractor: first_assistant
```

### all_assistant

Concatenates all assistant messages with a separator.

```yaml
extractor: all_assistant
extractor_config:
  separator: "\n\n"  # Join messages with double newline
```

### pattern

Extracts content matching a regex pattern.

```yaml
extractor: pattern
extractor_config:
  pattern: 'Result: (\d+)'  # Regex pattern to match
  group: 1  # Extract capture group 1
```

### tool_arguments

Extracts arguments from a specific tool call.

```yaml
extractor: tool_arguments
extractor_config:
  tool_name: search  # Which tool to extract from
```

### tool_output

Extracts the return value from a specific tool call.

```yaml
extractor: tool_output
extractor_config:
  tool_name: search
```

### memory_block

Extracts content from a specific memory block.

```yaml
extractor: memory_block
extractor_config:
  block_label: human  # Which memory block to extract
```

<Warning>
**Important**: This extractor requires the agent's final state, which adds overhead.
</Warning>

### after_marker

Extracts content after a specific marker string.

```yaml
extractor: after_marker
extractor_config:
  marker: "ANSWER:"
  include_marker: false
```
