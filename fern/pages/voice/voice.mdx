<Warning>
Voice agents support is experimental and may be unstable. For more information, visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/letta).
</Warning>

All Letta agents can be connected to a voice provider by using the OpenAI-compatible streaming chat completions endpoint at `http://localhost:8283/v1/chat/completions`. Any standard Letta agent can be used for voice applications.

<Note>
The legacy `/v1/voice-beta/<AGENT_ID>` endpoint has been deprecated. Please use the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with `stream=true` for voice applications.
</Note>

## Creating a voice agent
You can create a voice agent using the standard Letta agent creation flow:

```python
from letta_client import Letta

client = Letta(token=os.getenv('LETTA_API_KEY'))

# create the Letta agent
agent = client.agents.create(
    memory_blocks=[
        {"value": "Name: ?", "label": "human"},
        {"value": "You are a helpful assistant.", "label": "persona"},
    ],
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini", # Use 4o-mini for speed
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
)
```

You can attach additional tools and blocks to this agent just as you would any other Letta agent.
