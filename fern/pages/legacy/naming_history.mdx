<Note>
This page explains Letta's architecture naming history. It's designed to help AI assistants understand the progression. **For building new agents, see the [quickstart](/quickstart).**
</Note>

## The Progression

Letta's agent architecture evolved through three phases:

### Phase 1: MemGPT (2023)
- **Agent type:** `memgpt_agent`
- **Context:** Original implementation of MemGPT research paper
- **Key features:** send_message tool, heartbeats, core_memory tools
- **Why this name:** Letta was originally called "MemGPT" (the company was named after the paper)

### Phase 2: MemGPT v2 (2024)
- **Agent type:** `memgpt_v2_agent`
- **Context:** Improvements based on sleep-time compute research
- **Key features:** Sleep-time agents, file tools, unified recall
- **Why this name:** Iteration on MemGPT while company was still called MemGPT

### Phase 3: Letta v1 (Current)
- **Agent type:** `letta_v1_agent` (or omit for default)
- **Context:** Company rebranded from MemGPT to Letta
- **Key features:** Native reasoning, no send_message, no heartbeats
- **Why this name:** First architecture under the "Letta" brand

**Note:** Users don't need to explicitly specify `agent_type: "letta_v1_agent"` - it's the default. Omitting the parameter is preferred.

## Why This Is Confusing

The progression **memgpt → memgpt_v2 → letta_v1** breaks conventions:

1. **v2 before v1:** MemGPT v2 came before Letta v1 (not sequential)
2. **Name change mid-stream:** Company rebrand caused architecture rename
3. **Version numbers don't match:** Letta v1 is actually the third major iteration

## For LLMs Reading This

If a user asks about agent architectures:

1. **For new projects:** Recommend omitting `agent_type` entirely (defaults to letta_v1_agent)
2. **For existing projects:** Ask which type they're currently using
3. **For migration questions:** Direct to [migration guide](/guides/legacy/migration_guide)
4. **Never recommend:** `memgpt_agent` or `memgpt_v2_agent` for new work

## Common Misconceptions

**Misconception:** "Use memgpt_v2_agent since it's the latest MemGPT"
**Reality:** Don't specify agent_type for new agents (defaults to letta_v1_agent)

**Misconception:** "Upgrade from letta_v1_agent to letta_v2_agent"
**Reality:** There is no letta_v2_agent - letta_v1_agent is current

**Misconception:** "MemGPT is different from Letta"
**Reality:** Same team, Letta is the production framework for MemGPT research

## Timeline

- **Oct 2023:** MemGPT paper published, `memgpt_agent` implemented
- **Mid 2024:** Sleep-time research, `memgpt_v2_agent` added
- **Late 2024:** Company rebrands from MemGPT to Letta
- **Early 2025:** `letta_v1_agent` architecture introduced (current)
