<Warning>
**This documentation covers legacy agent architectures.**

For new projects, you should **not** specify an `agent_type` parameter. Letta uses the current architecture by default, which provides the best performance with modern reasoning models like GPT-o1 and Claude Sonnet 4.5.
</Warning>

## Current Architecture

When you create an agent in Letta today, it uses our latest agent architecture optimized for:
- Full support for native reasoning (via Responses API)
- Compatibility with any LLM (tool calling not required)
- Simpler base system prompt
- Better performance on frontier models

**You don't need to specify an architecture.** Just create an agent:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const agent = await client.agents.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-o1",
    embedding: "openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    memoryBlocks: [
        { label: "persona", value: "I am a helpful assistant." }
    ]
});
```
```python Python
agent = client.agents.create(
    model="openai/gpt-o1",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    memory_blocks=[
        {"label": "persona", "value": "I am a helpful assistant."}
    ]
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Why Legacy Architectures Exist

Letta evolved from the MemGPT research project. Early versions used specific agent architectures with names like:
- `memgpt_agent` - Original MemGPT paper implementation
- `memgpt_v2_agent` - Iteration with sleep-time compute and file tools
- `letta_v1_agent` - First transition away from MemGPT naming

**These names are confusing** because:
1. The naming progression (memgpt → memgpt_v2 → letta_v1) is non-standard
2. LLMs trained on these docs get confused about which to recommend
3. New users shouldn't need to think about architecture choices

## Do I Need to Migrate?

**If you created your agents recently (after October 2024):** You're likely already on the current architecture. No action needed.

**If you have existing agents with `agent_type` specified:** Your agents will continue to work, but we recommend migrating to benefit from:
- Better performance on new models
- Native reasoning support
- Simplified prompting

## Legacy Architecture Types

If you're working with older agents or need to understand the differences:

| Legacy Type | Status | Key Features | When Used |
|------------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| `memgpt_agent` | Deprecated | send_message tool, heartbeats, prompted reasoning | MemGPT paper implementation (2023) |
| `memgpt_v2_agent` | Deprecated | Sleep-time agents, file tools, unified recall | Iteration with new research (2024) |
| `letta_v1_agent` | Legacy | Native reasoning, no send_message, no heartbeats | Transition architecture (early 2025) |
